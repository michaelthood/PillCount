# PillCount
<#Physician Assistan/nurse counts the patients controlled substances.
Purpose of program is to make sure the patients pill count is correct.

Next the program establishes the dates for the next 3 prescriptions 
(dates that they can be filled).
Another nicety would be different statements if the patient has more 
meds that supposed to instead of negative numbers. I will do this next.
